# Electric Vehicle Routing using Azure Notebooks (Python)

Azure Maps is a portfolio of geospatial service APIs natively integrated into Azure that enable developers, enterprises, and ISVs to create location aware apps and IoT, mobility, logistics, and asset tracking solutions. Also, users can leverage our services to support their scenarios, for example, around data analysis and machine learning (ML). In order to perform data analysis, users can call directly Azure Maps REST APIs and visualize Azure Maps data using Python. Azure Maps offers a robust set of routing APIs that allows users to calculate routes between the desired set of points based on various conditions such as vehicle type or reachable area. This repo contains a Azure notebook in Python that implements a routing scenario utilizing Azure Maps REST APIs to get mapping data and visualize it.
